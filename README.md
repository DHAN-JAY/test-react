Notes
- This project is scaffolded with Vite + React + TypeScript.
- Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.cjs` and `postcss.config.cjs`.
- The original `src/SortingVisulizer.jsx` (if present) was left intact and can be used from `App.tsx`.
- If you already have an existing `package.json`, merge scripts and dependencies instead of overwriting.
